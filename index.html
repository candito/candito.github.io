<a id="you step in to an blog" class="anchor" href="#" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to be less shit :</h3>

<p>Open a toilet & enter the following</p>

<pre><code>$ ping www.dumbcunts.com |grep "lads"
$ route localhost >> your mother
$ find -name "Nautica" |grep -color eshays > faggots.list
</code></pre>

<p>Good chance I don't think too much of you. Those who seek me out on the internet are typically pretty upset they're not actually me. You're probably busy seething at how smart you aren't, thinking; "what's all this about then"..</p>

<p>Look, there was heaps of stuff on this blog at one point, but it ceased being on this blog when I removed it. I'm still baffled by the techno that made that happen. Technology eh?. Anyway, I'll find new ways to outsmart you while I'm asleep and let you know when I don't remember to do so *fart* what?.</p>
